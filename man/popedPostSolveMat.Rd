\title{Get Solved f based on matched solving times}
\usage{
popedPostSolveMat(matMT, env)
}
\arguments{
\item{matMT}{This is the solved matrix that with the following columns (in order):
\itemize{
\item \code{time}
\item For each endpoint it needs the following (repeated for each endpoint):
\itemize{
\item endpoint prediction (f)
\item endpoint prediction variance (w)
}
}}

\item{env}{This is an R environment where the boolean indexes of
which item is a which modeling switch is saved (as well as the
last data frame solved created by this method)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following output items:
\itemize{
\item \code{t} The time points
\item \code{ms} The model switch
\item \code{rx_pred_} The predicted value
\item \code{w} The variance of the predicted value
}

This also has a side effect of saving the data.frame in the
environment as \code{s} and the boolean indexes of which item is a
which modeling switch is saved in the environment as \code{we}

(i.e. env$we[\link{1}] is a boolean vector of which items are model switch 1,
env$we[\link{2}] is a boolean vector of which items are model switch 2, etc.)
}
\description{
This function takes the solved matrix and matches it to the order
of the input times and model_switch from \code{PopED}.  It assumes
the global time indexer has been setup with something like
\code{babelmixr2::popedMultipleEndpointParam()}
