# This example shows how to include a prior FIM into the design evaluation.
# We look at PK assessment in pediatrics, where we are mainly interested 
# in assessing if there is a substantial difference of more than 20% in 
# clearance (CL) between children and adults.

# First we setup the general model, then the designs for adults and pediatrics, 
# and finally we can evaluate the separate designs and the pooled data.

##-- Model: One comp first order absorption
## -- Analytic solution for both mutiple and single dosing
